# odin-recipes

A recipe website following ThOdinProject's 'Project: Recipes' lesson

It was not really that hard to make(it was very tedious because I had to manually make all the recipe pages) but it was fun and exciting!

After completing this project, I should have demonstrated the following things:

-My knowedge of basic HTML -My knowedge of basic Git and Github -My knowedge of basic file structure -My knowedge of writing good commit messages

        <h1>Carrot Cake</h1>
        <img src="carrotcake.jpg">
        <p>This cake is surprisingly simple to make!I am a bit biased because carrot cake is my favoirte!</p>
            <p>There is something about a moist crumb, the perfect amount of spices, and a cream cheese frosting. It is sweet without being too sweet. Crafted with the right amount ofd butter and oil and just the right amount of carrots, the flavor is so good you will have a second piece (or third)</p>
